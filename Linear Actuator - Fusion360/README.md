I  designed a simplified linear actuator for solar tracking applications, based on the LINAK LA35 datasheet. After analyzing the datasheet and assignment requirements, I modelled the actuator and its main components, and prepared full technical drawings in both 3rd-angle orthographic and isometric projection, as well as detailed hand drawings.
